Music player with songs released for free. Now i can listen to music that is not on spotify, you can too, feel free to use it! :D
Player is connected with my [api](https://github.com/jarek-janowski/music-api), so i will update my player everytime i find something cool to add there. You can add song to favourites and listen whatever you like. Go [there](https://jarek-janowski.github.io/music-player/) and try it!
